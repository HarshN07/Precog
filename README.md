# Precog - Language Representations
Precog Recruitment Task
**Project Description**
This project explores word embeddings using co-occurrence matrices and pre-trained neural embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe. We have further investigated the cross-lingual alignment, mapping pre-trained Hindi embeddings into pre-trained English embedding space using multivariate variables relating methods like Procrustes analysis.
